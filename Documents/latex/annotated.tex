\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_substance}{Substance}} \\*The substance class is a type of interface (base class) that provides the basic necessary functionality for using Open\+GL shaders. The class is designed to be expandable so that you can override certain methods and functionality to better fit the requirments of any custom written shaders. An instance of the \textquotesingle{}\mbox{\hyperlink{class_substance}{Substance}}\textquotesingle{} class can be attached to a \textquotesingle{}Mesh-\/\+Renderer\textquotesingle{} where the shader can be \textquotesingle{}loaded\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}binded\textquotesingle{} and excuted during runtime. }{\pageref{class_substance}}{}
